# Merge sort 

For this assignment, you are going to implement merge sort. A skeleton file has been provided called `sort.c`. You will know your result is correct, if the data you have sorted is done so in ascending order.

## Mergesort at a high level

Merge sort is a [divide and conquer algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm) that was invented by [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) in 1945. Merge sort has a worst-case time complexity being ÎŸ(n log n), which is the best we have seen so far. 

Merge sort works as follows:

1. Divide the unsorted array into n subarrays, each containing one element (an array of one element is considered sorted).
2. Repeatedly merge subarrays to produce new sorted subarrays until there is only one subarray remaining. This will be the sorted array.

As they say a pictuer is worth a thousand words:

A more detailed pseudo-code would look like this:

```cpp
MergeSort(arr[], l,  r)
If r > l
     1. Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves:  
             middle m = (l+r)/2
     2. Call mergeSort for first half:   
             Call mergeSort(arr, l, m)
     3. Call mergeSort for second half:
             Call mergeSort(arr, m+1, r)
     4. Merge the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3:
             Call merge(arr, l, m, r)
 ```  
           

Note that merge sort is not an [in-place algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) as it needs to crete new arrays everytime it merges. However, it is more efficient than Selection, Insertion, or Bubble sort. 

You can watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=JSceec-wEyw) to visually see how merge sort works.

## Designing the algorithm

An algorithm itself does not have to be one single function. Sometimes it is helpful to have some 'helper functions' to make the code easier to understand. For merge sort, you would need at least two functions: 

1. mergeSort -- the main sort function
2. merge -- the main chunk of the algorithm. 

## Compiling and running the program.

When you have made an attempt at the sorting algorithm, go ahead and try to run it. Remember to save, compile, and test early and often!

* Compile the source code with: `clang sort.c -o sort`
* Run the source code with: `./sort`

# Deliverable

- Modify the file called **sort.c** and implement a version of merge sort that sorts numbers in ascending order.
  
# Rubric

- 50% Correct implementation of merge sort (and not some other sort)
  - There should be no memory leaks
  - There should be no bugs in your functions 
  - Your implementation will be graded by our set of unit tests, and we will check your code 'style' as well.

# (Optional) Going Further Task:

(This is an ungraded task--only work on this if you finish the deliverable). You will have to do a little bit of work to figure out how to open and read from files for this task.

- Implement insertion sort, but this time, use a linked list as the storage data structure, instead of an array.
