# Binary Search Tree *(BST)*

In Assignment 3 you implemented what is callled a [doubly linked list or a DLL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list/).
The code for our node struct looked like this:

```cpp
typedef struct node{
	int myData;
	struct node* head;
        struct node* tail;
}node_t;
```

Similarly our *DLL* (Assignment 3, Part 1) looked like this:

```cpp
typedef struct DLL{
	int count;		// count keeps track of how many items are in the DLL.
	node_t* head;		// head points to the first node in our DLL.
        node_t * tail;          //tail points to the last node in our DLL.
}dll_t;
```

In this assignment we are going to build on these ideas to create what is called a [binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) or a *BST*.

# What is a *Binary Search Tree*

<img align="right" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Binary_tree.svg" alt="Binary Tree Picture"> 

A BST is a [binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree). A Binary tree as shown in the picture on the right is better suited for showing hierarchical relationships between data (i.e. parent-child relationship), when compared to a list, stack or a DLL. 

A binary tree is like a DLL in that it is composed of nodes.  A binary tree node is like a DLL node, but rather having a *previous* and a *next* pointer, it has a *rightChild* and a *leftChild* pointer. 

```cpp
typedef struct node{
	int myData;
	struct node* rightChild;
        struct node* leftChild;
}node_t;
```

Like a DLL, a binary tree has only one pointer called *root* that points to the beginning of the tree. 

```cpp
typedef struct binary_tree{
	int count;		// count keeps track of how many items are in the DLL.
	node_t* root;		// head points to the first node in our DLL.
}binary_tree;
```

# Adding elements to a binary tree, the pictures behind the code. 

The first element we add to an empty tree will become the *root* node. Upon adding another element we have to decide where we will put the new element, to the left or to the right of our root node. 

<img width="300px" src="./../images/SampleTree1.png">

For example:

```cpp
...
root->left = new_node;
//or
root->right = new_node;
```
In a binary search tree, if the new node is smaller than the root we add it to the left, otherwise we add it to the right.

```cpp
...
if ( new_node->data < root->data)
    root->left = new_node;
else
    root->right = new_node;
```

## Constructing a tree, step-by-step

Lets construct an empty new tree and add *20* to it.

```cpp
binary_tree t = create_tree();
add(t, 20)
```
<img width="80" src="./../images/20.png">

The tree is initally empty so *20* becomes our *root* node.

Now we add *10*. We look at *root* and we know that we need to go left, since *10* is less than *20*. There is no node to the left of *20*, thus we create new node to the left of the *root* and store *10* in it. We make this new node be the *leftChild* of the root.

```cpp
add(t, 10)
```
<img width="150" src="./../images/20-10.png">

Now we add *15*. *15* is less than the root, so we need to go left. However, there is another node there namely the node storing *10*. So we repeat the same process. *15* is larger than *10* so we know that we need to to the right of *10*. There is no node to the right of *10* so we create a new node, store *15* in the node, and make our new node be the right child of the node storing *10*. 

```cpp
add(t, 15)
```

<img width="200" src="./../images/20-10-15.png">


We then add *30* which is larger than *root* so we add it to the right. 

```cpp
add(t, 30)
```
<img width="250" src="./../images/20-10-15-30.png">

We then add *25*. *25* is larger than the *root*, we go right. *25* is less than *30* so we go to the left of *30*, no node there so we add *25* to the right of 30.

```cpp
add(t, 25)
```
<img width="350" src="./../images/20-10-15-30-25.png">

We then add *5*. *5* is less than the *root*, go left, *5* is less than *10* go left, no node there, add *5* to the left of *10*.

```cpp
add(t, 5)
```
<img width="350" src="./../images/20-10-15-30-25-5.png">

We then add *35*, *35* is larger than *root* so we go right, still larger than *30* so we go right, no node there, so we add *35* to the right of *30*.


```cpp
add(t, 35)
```
<img width="350" src="./../images/20-10-15-30-25-5-35.png">

# TO DO:

* Implement the *add* function ( hint: needs to be recursive ).
* Implement *find* that returns 1 if the data exists in the tree otherwise return 0. 
* Implement *print_tree* that prints the tree in ascending or descending order depending on an argument passed to the function.
* Implement *sum* that returns the sum of all the nodes in the tree. 

### Unit Tests

A unit test is a standalone test that checks for the correctness of a specific use case in your code. In our case, we are testing if we have a working *binary search tree* implementation. 

You need to write unit tests to test your implementation.


# Rubric

- Part 1
- 50% Correct Binary-Search-Tree implementation
  - All functions should be implemented. Do not rename the functions, but you may add any 'helper' functions if you deem necessary.
    - (e.g. You might have a 'binary_search_tree_print' to help you debug)
  - There should be no memory leaks
  - There should be no bugs in your functions 
  - Your implementation will be graded by our set of unit tests, and we will check your code 'style' as well.
