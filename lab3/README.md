It is amazing how fast computers can search and find information. Think about how long it would take you to look through more than 500,000 books in a library? So what is the big trick computers use for finding the right information so quickly? Simple--we sort all of the data prior to searching.

## What did we previously learn about searching? Complexity Matters.

Previously we learned that a binary search is faster than a linear search (it helps us make better guesses when searching for information). A linear search means looking through each piece of information one at a time, while a binary search can eliminate half of the possibilities each time. We often compare algorithms based on their *complexity class* to figure out their efficiency.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Algorithm</th>
      <th align="center">Complexity</th>
      <th>n = 100</th>
      <th>n = 100,000</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Linear Search</td>
      <td align="left">O(n)</td>
      <td>100</td>
      <td>100,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Binary Search</td>
      <td align="left">Log(n)</td>
      <td>6.64</td>
      <td>16.60</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

From the table, if we are given 'n' number of items to search, then log(n) will be smaller than O(n). The classic way to view this is visually. In the chart below, as our input grows(along the x-axis), the lower the height(on the y-axis, typically representing time) we like to have for our algorithms. Log(n) is clearly lower (thus better) than O(n).

Now, just like there are several algorithms for searching for data, there are a range of slow to fast algorithms for sorting data. We will start with an algorithm that does an *okay* job at sorting, and then figure out how to make it more efficient in future labs!

# Part 1 - Selection Sort 

For this assignment, you are going to implement in 'C' selection sort. A skeleton file has been provided called `sort.c`. You will know your result is correct, if the data you have sorted is done so in ascending order.

## Selection sort at a high level

The selection sort algorithm at a high level, works by repeatedly finding the minimum value in an array and placing it in the correct position. You can imagine yourself going through your wallet and swapping the smaller bills with the bigger bills to be put in front, and continuously thumbing through your wallet to make sure it is in order. Another analogy would be if you are shuffling cards, and swapping the positions of each card in your hand to get an ascending order.

The expected output of sorting an array in ascending order is the following: an array with the values `[50,5,20,10,1]` would be sorted in ascending order to be `[1,5,10,20,50]`. 

## Pseudo-code

The pseudo-code for selection sort goes as follows
```c
1. Iterate through your array and find the smallest element in an array
2. Swap the smallest element with the first element of the array
3. Iterate again through your array, but this time, find the second smallest element and place it in the second position.
   - You know the smallest element is in the first position already, so you are swapping in the second position 
   - As you follow this pattern, you build a 'partially sorted' array, until you reach the end of your array..
```

Take a moment to think about how we would sort in descending order. What would we be searching for in the array? If you said the maximum value, you are correct! Thus, if we want to sort in descending order, then we would select the maximum value through each iteration..

Note: Regardles if we are using an array or a linked list, the algorithm looks the same. However, for this lab, an array is slightly easier to work with.

## Designing the algorithm

An algorithm itself does not have to be one single function. Sometimes it is helpful to have some 'helper functions' to make the code easier to understand. For selection sort, I recommend three different functions, and the function stubs have been provided.

1. swap -- Swaps two integers in an array
2. findMinimum -- Finds at which index in an array the minimum value is found (Note: this is the index, not the actual value).
3. sortIntegers -- This is where you will perform the actual selection sort.

## Compiling and running the program.

When you have made an attempt at the sorting algorithm, go ahead and try to run it. Remember to save, compile, and test early and often!

* Compile the source code with: `clang sort.c -o sort`
* Run the source code with: `./sort`

# Part 2 - Selection Sort Complexity Q & A.

Discuss and answer the following questions:

1. What do you think the Big-Oh (worst-case) complexity of this algorithm is? 
2. What do you think the best-case complexity of this algorithm is? Note-- you do not have any information about if the array is already sorted or not.
3. Does selection sort require any additional storage beyond the original array? 

## Answers:

1. O(n^2). There are two nested loops, which means it must be O(n^2).  In worst case, you must compare every single element with every other element to its right in the array so it is not good for big lists. The algorithims performance is proportional to the size of the data set squared.

2. Ω(n^2). Even in best case, you need to iterate till you find the minimum every iteration since you do not know which element is the smallest until the end of the non-sorted part/ remainder of the array. Therefore even in best case first iteration would take n-1 to find minimum, then n-2, since the program wont 'know' if it already found the minimum.

3. No....not other than the constant space it would need for loops etc. Also, it never makes more than O(n) swaps.

# Deliverable

- Modify the file called **sort.c** and implement a version of selection sort that sorts numbers in ascending order.

# (Optional) Going Further Task:

(This is an ungraded task--only work on this if you finish the deliverable). You will have to do a little bit of work to figure out how to open and read from files for this task.

- Implement bubble sort
- Implement selection sort, but this time, use a linked list as the storage data structure, instead of an array.
